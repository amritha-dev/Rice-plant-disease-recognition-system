                The "RiceLeafDisease" dataset: This article presents an image collection that was recently
                 collected and features eight different rice leaf diseases from other areas of Bangladesh. 
                There are eight classifications: Bacterial Leaf Blight (Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae), Brown Spot (Cochliobolus miyabeanus), 
                Leaf scald (Microdochium oryzae), Narrow Brown Leaf Spot (Cercospora janseana), Rice Hispa (Dicladispa armigera),
                 Sheath Blight (Rhizoctonia solani), Leaf Blast (Pyricularia oryzae) and Healthy Rice Leaf. 
                The collection comprises 1701 original images and 5188 augmented photos of Rice Leaf Diseases.
                 Each original image was taken in adequate natural light against a suitable backdrop.
