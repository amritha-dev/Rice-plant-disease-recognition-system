# Rice-plant-disease-recognition-system
Rice plant disease recognition system using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model implemented in TensorFlow. The primary goal was to accurately identify and classify various diseases affecting rice plants from leaf images. I  utilized Streamlit to create an interactive web application,making it easy for users to upload images and receive instant predictions. The web app provides a user-friendly interface, allowing farmers, agronomists, and researchers to diagnose rice plant diseases quickly and effectively, contributing to better crop management and reduced yield losses.
Key features of the project include:

Deep Learning Model: A CNN model trained in TensorFlow to achieve high accuracy in disease classification.
Web App: A Streamlit-based interface for real-time disease recognition.
User Accessibility: Easy-to-use platform enabling non-technical users to benefit from AI-powered disease diagnostics.

This project highlights the application of deep learning in agriculture, demonstrating how AI can support sustainable farming practices and enhance food security.
